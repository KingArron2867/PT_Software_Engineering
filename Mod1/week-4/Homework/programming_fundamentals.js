/*
DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself; use things like loops, functions, classes so your code is clean and not repeting itself.
KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid; dont over complicate.
Avoid creating a YAGNI: You arenâ€™t going to need it; dont use functions untill you need 
Do the simplest thing that could possibly work: the easiest way to do something. do that. 
Don't make me think: your code should be simple, easy to read/ understand so anyone can understand it.
Write code for the maintainer: so the person, a stranger, could read and maintaine your code easily
Single responsibility principle: class or function should do that one thing and do it well
Avoid premature optimization: don't optimize untill your code works.
Separation of concerns: different tasks need to be handled differently.
